While public authorities were still permitted under those provisions to institutionalise individuals against their will and for their own safety, the new statutes established conditions applicable nationwide for ordering such a major infringement of an individual's basic rights. Prior to the adoption of the federal provisions on involuntary commitment, the rules on administrative detention in almost all of the cantons failed, with few exceptions, to provide for any judicial appeals process in such cases.",

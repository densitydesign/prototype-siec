(…) Nul ne peut être interné dans un établissement public ou privé destiné à la garde et au traitement des aliénés, sans une autorisation du Département de justie et police. Lorsqu'il y aura danger manifeste pour la sécurité des personnes, les directeurs d'établissements publics pourront reçevoir des aliénés dont l'identité est justifiée, et sur le vu d'un certificat médical, à charge d'obtenir l'autorisation du Département de justice et police, dans les vingt-quatre heures qui suivront l'internement.
